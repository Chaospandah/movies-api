# Movies API

Hey! I made a simple Movies API built with FastAPI. I'm currently practicing working with/creating API's, Git, and MDX/markdown for a dev-tools support role. 

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Markdown / MDX for documentation
- Git & GitHub

## Running the API
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### API
I created a quick API to keep on practicing working with them. Honestly having a lot of fun working with API's as of right now.

### Git
Was messing around with creating new branches and merging branches to be more familiar with git commands. I can say I'm pretty proficent with using git right now.

### MDX/mardown
Created docs for the features, wasn't too concerned in the content of the docs itself just wanted to continue practicing MDX syntax and getting itn the rhythem of working with those docs.
I might update the docs to make them look better in the future, but as of right now sorry if they look bad!
